### Michael Elkerton

I was first introduced to programming through a CDI course I took for web design in 2004 and was immediately fascinated. Soon after I completed that program I found employment as a LAMP developer for a small company that I still currently work for. Around 6 years ago I decided to pursue my degree in Computer Science and finally completed my last semester in the fall of 2022.

I enjoy learning new languages and recently have discovered Dart and have been enjoying that quite a bit, PostrgestCrud is my first Dart project as well as my first public software package. Rust, Haskell, and Prolog are some of the other languages I am currently attempting to learn. My bread and butter over the past decade has been a typical web stack; i.e. PHP, HTML5, Javascript (Typescript), and MySql. Some of the languages that I am comfortable with include C, C++, GoLang, Python, and Bash.
