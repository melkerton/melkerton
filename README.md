### Michael Elkerton

I was first introduced to programming through a CDI course I took for web design in 2004 and was immediately fascinated. Soon after I completed that program I found employment as a LAMP developer for a small company that I still currently work for. Around 6 years ago I decided to pursue my degree in Computer Science which I finally completed in the fall of 2022.

... in progress.
